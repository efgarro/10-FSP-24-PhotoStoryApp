# **PhotoStory React App**

This project is part of the Full Stack Designer Codecademy curriculum that completes Module 24 - Portafolio Project. This project however, uses the Unsplash API to instead of the Reddit API, to build some features of the 'Soy Costa Rica' Destination App. All tasks and requirements were modified accordingly.

## Technical Hightlights of this App

- This App retrieves images from the Unplash API that most closely describe the region's ambience, look and feel.
- The Search Bar retrieves images from Unspash API based on the `searchTerm` provided.
- The layout system uses [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout) library to display and organize the images in columns.
- The domain name to view this project is [soy-crc.com](https://soy-crc.com).
- A Cloudflare account stores and optimizes the _services and activity_ images for each region. Additionally, it _builds_ the project through automatic deployment from a [Github repository](https://github.com/efgarro/10-FSP-24-PhotoStoryApp).
